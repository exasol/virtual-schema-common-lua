# Developer Guide

## Preparation

Before you can build and test the application, you need to install Lua packages on the build machine.

### Installing LuaRocks

First install the package manager LuaRocks.

```bash
sudo apt install luarocks
```

Now update your `LUA_PATH`, so that it contains the packages (aka. "rocks"). You can auto-generate that path.

```bash
luarocks path
```

Of course generating it is not enough, you also need to make sure the export is actually executed &mdash; preferably automatically each time. Here is an example that appends the path to the `.bashrc`:

```bash
luarocks path >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Installing the Required Lua Packages

You need the packages for unit testing, mocking and JSON processing.

Execute as `root` or modify to install in your home directory:

```bash
sudo luarocks install LuaUnit
sudo luarocks install Mockagne
sudo luarocks install lua-cjson
sudo luarocks install remotelog
sudo luarocks install luacov
sudo luarocks install luacov-coveralls
sudo luarocks install luacheck
```

Most of those packages are only required for testing. While `cjson` is needed at runtime, it is prepackaged with Exasol, so no need to install it at runtime.

The `luacov` and `luacov-coveralls` libraries take care of measuring and reporting code coverage in the tests.

### Bundling the Main Script and the Modules

As most non-trivial pieces of software, `row-level-security-lua` is modularized. While it is possible to install individual modules as Lua scripts in Exasol, this is also a lot of work. And the more modules you install individually, the higher the chances you forget to update one of them. A safer and more convenient way is to bundle everything into one script before the installation using [lua-amalg](https://github.com/siffiejoe/lua-amalg/).

To make this process easier, the [Maven POM file](../../pom.xml) contains an execution that automates this step. Still it is necessary to add new modules by hand in the list of modules to be bundled in the POM.

Note that the entry point `request_dispatcher.lua` is a regular Lua script that must be added to the bundle using the `-s` switch and its relative path. The remaining bundle elements are Lua modules and must be listed in dot-notation.

To make a bundle via Maven run the following command:

```bash
mvn exec:exec@bundle
```

This is quite fast since it skips the other Maven steps.

## How to Run Lua Unit Tests

### Run Unit Tests From Terminal

To run unit tests from terminal, you first need to install Lua:

```bash
sudo apt install lua5.1
```

Another important thing to do, you need to add the project's directories with lua files to LUA_PATH environment variable.
We add two absolute paths, one to the `main` and another to the `test` folder: 

```bash
export LUA_PATH='/home/<absolute>/<path>/row-level-security-lua/src/main/lua/?.lua;/home/<absolute>/<path>/row-level-security-lua/src/test/lua/?.lua;'"$LUA_PATH"
```

After that you can try to run any test file:

```bash
lua src/test/lua/exasolvs/test_query_renderer.lua 
```

If you want to run all unit tests including code coverage and static code analysis, issue the following command:

```bash
tools/runtests.sh
```

The test output contains summaries and you will find reports in the `luaunit-reports` and `luacov-reports` directories.

### Running the Unit Tests From Intellij IDEA

First, you need to install a plug-in that handles Lua code. We recommend to use `lua` plugin by `sylvanaar`.

In the next step we add a Lua interpreter. Fow that go to `File` &rarr; `Project structure` &rarr; `Modules`.
Here press `Add` button in the upper left corner and add a new Lua framework.
You can use one of the default Lua interpreters suggested by Intellij or add your own in `SDKs` tab of the `Project structure`.
We recommend installing and using `lua5.1`.

Now add the `LUA_PATH` environment variable here too. Go to `Run` &rarr; `Edit configurations` &rarr; `Templates` &rarr; `Lua Script`.
We assume that you have already run the tests via a terminal and you added an environment variable there. Now check it via a terminal command:

```bash
echo $LUA_PATH
```

Copy the output, in the `Environment variables` field press `Browse` &rarr; `Add`.
Paste the lines you copied to the `Value` field and add `LUA_PATH` as a `Name`.
  
Now you can right-click any unit-test class and `Run...` or use hot keys `[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [F10]`.

### Running the Unit Tests From Eclipse IDE

We recommend you install the [Lua Development Tools (LDT)](https://www.eclipse.org/ldt/) when working on this project using the Eclipse IDE. If you add the Lua nature to the project, you can set the paths `src/main/lua` and `src/test/lua` as source paths. This way you can directly run the unit test as Lua application (`[CTRL] + [F11]`) without further configuration.
